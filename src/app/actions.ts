// Removed generateMotivationalMessage and related types as they are no longer used by the client.
// Motivational messages are now sourced locally from src/lib/motivationalMessages.ts.

// Example of keeping the file structure if other actions are added later:
// export async function someOtherAction(input: any): Promise<any> {
//   // ...
// }
